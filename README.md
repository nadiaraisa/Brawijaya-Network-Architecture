# Brawijaya-Network-Architecture
Final Project of Internet Protocol and Architecture

**GitHub Repository Description:**

This repository showcases a comprehensive exploration of Internet Protocol and Architecture through a final project. The project focuses on the practical implementation of various routing protocols in distinct network topologies. 

**Features:**
1. **Static Routing in FPIK Topology:** Explore the use of static routing in the context of the FPIK network topology.

2. **EIGRP in FIA Topology:** Experience the advantages of EIGRP, an interior routing protocol developed by Cisco Systems, demonstrated in the FIA network topology for enhanced performance and reliability.

3. **OSPF in FILKOM Topology:** Delve into the capabilities of OSPF, an interior routing protocol used to calculate the shortest routes based on specific metrics such as bandwidth and distance. See its application in the FILKOM network topology.

4. **BGP for Interconnecting Routing Systems:** Understand the role of BGP, an exterior routing protocol, in facilitating the exchange of routing information between different networks. Witness its implementation in the project, connecting three routing systems: static, EIGRP, and OSPF.

**Key Technologies:**
- Cisco Systems technologies
- Static Routing
- EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
- OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
- BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

**Objective:**
This repository serves as a valuable resource for learning and understanding the practical deployment of routing protocols in diverse network scenarios. The examples provided highlight the significance of each protocol in specific topologies, offering insights into their functionalities and applications in real-world networking.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and adapt the project to further your understanding of Internet Protocol and Architecture.
